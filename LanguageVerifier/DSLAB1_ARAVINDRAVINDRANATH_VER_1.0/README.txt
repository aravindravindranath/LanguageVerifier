Project by Aravind Ravindranath

The source code was developed in JAVA 1.8. It was developed using Eclipse Neon.
Eclipse IDE details ( Version: Neon.3 Release (4.6.3)
					  Build id: 20170314-1500 )

To run the program, enter:  java com.jhu.ds.lab1.IOoperations.ProcessInputCheckLang
							[Integer numberofprompts].

The program keeps on asking the user to enter the Input File and Output File equal
to the numberofprompts times. If valid files are entered, the loop exits. If no 
argument is entered a default value of 5 prompts is set.

The file path is relative to the project folder and inputFile should be clearly 
specified. If there is a folder Input  under the project folder in which the 
input file LabInput1 is kept, then the command line should have ../Input/LabInput1 when 
executed from folder bin.If executed in an IDE like eclipse, then 
/Input/LabInput1 shall work. The output file contains the results of the language
verifier. The file path or the file names are not hard coded.

Analysis document is provided in the Analysis Folder.
